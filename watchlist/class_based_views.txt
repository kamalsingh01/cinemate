1. Requests passed to the handler methods will be REST framework's Request instances, not Django's HttpRequest instances.
2. Handler methods may return REST framework's Response, instead of Django's HttpResponse. The view will manage content negotiation and setting the correct renderer on the response.
3. Any APIException exceptions will be caught and mediated into appropriate responses.
4. Incoming requests will be authenticated and appropriate permission and/or throttle checks will be run before dispatching the request to the handler method, meaning authentication and permissions are checked before making call to handler methods.
 

 5. We create view class and extend API view. inside, Instead of defining condition for checking the request method, we can directly use Httprequest based methods provided by API View class
> We do not need to define any decorator with our class based views.
